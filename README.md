# Module_9-surfs_up

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the year round sustainability of a surf/ice cream shop in Oahu by comparing temperatures during both June and December over the course of multiple years.

# Results

The major point to be taken from the results of this analysis is that, at least judging by temperature, the surf shop in Oahu seems to be a viable year round business. Over multiple years, the average June temperature (74.94) barely differs from the average December temperature (71.04) in Oahu. As expected, June temperatures tend to be a bit higher, but overall the two months are far more similar than I would have expected.

There is a quite a wide range of recorded temperatures reported within each month, indicating that there may be some noteworthy fluctuations in temperature within a given month from day to day, week to week, or even year to year. This phenomena is a bit more prominent in December, where the standard deviation is 3.74 as opposed to 3.25 in June, both of which seem a bit large, though perhaps not for weather data, which may have frequent outliers. 

# Summary

- break down of the data with a line graph or bar graph by year - to determine longer term trends (ex. is Oahu generally getting warmer or cooler?, how much variation is there in temperature year to year?)
